# coin_orderbook

## Concept
+ It's possible to scale out with one core(engine) and multiple backends

## Points for improvement
+ Need to change the way we read the config
+ Refactor duplicated code into a node_modules package
+ Frontend refactoring is needed
+ App refactoring is needed(I'm considering deleting it from the repository)

## Description
+ Provide cryptocurrency prices from multiple exchanges in a single page
+ Provides real-time coin information for the ETH/BTC market on exchange Binance(ID: 1) and exchange Bitfinex(ID: 3)
